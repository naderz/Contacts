# Contacts
This is a simple app that fetches a list using Retrofit and displays it. 
Clicking on a list item you will then go to another activity to see the details of the item that was clicked.
Going landspace mode will then transform the Activity into a Master Detail view and both list and details fragments are viewable side by side.
This is implemented using MVP architecture.
